BushSurvival.py

A re-make of a game I played when I was a kid (and what I can remember of it). As I worked my way through 'Learn Python the Hard Way', I wanted to work on 'something', so I decided this was a fun little task.

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer.

p.s. if you improve this, all I ask is that you share it with me!  Thanks!
